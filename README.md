# Web User Management System

Welcome to the Web User Management System repository! This project was developed as part of the "Programação para Internet" (Web Programming) course. It allows users to add, filter, and remove names, updating a list presented in the HTML interface. The implementation includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Add names to the user list.
- Remove names from the user list.
- Filter names in real-time.
- Navigate through the list with a selection feature.

## Code Overview
The JavaScript code utilizes an array (`nameList`) to manage user names and a counter (`contador`) to keep track of the selected user. The provided functions include:

- **filllist:** Updates the HTML list with the current array of names.
- **adicionar:** Adds a new name to the list and updates the display.
- **selecionar:** Navigates through the user list, highlighting the selected user.
- **filtrar:** Filters the user list based on the input search field.
- **remover:** Removes the selected user from the list.
